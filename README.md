A lightweight front-end on top of Genius that allows users to look-up their favorite song lyrics without extra hassle.

## Stack

- React with TypeScript
- ESLint using Airbnb, Prettier, TypeScript
- Jest for testing components

## What's the point?

- Work with third-party API data and find ways to get required data that API does not provide
  - For legal reasons, Genius cannot provide full song lyrics within API data; however, API data can provide URLs needed to make fetch requests for those pages containing lyrics and other fun things.

- Create a React app using TypeScript within TDD approach (Test-Driven Development)
